      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, Iâ€™m Timothy Baraka, a software engineer passionate about building
        scalable, high-performance web applications. I thrive on solving
        problems and turning complex ideas into functional systems. My expertise
        spans backend, frontend, DevOps, and software architecture. I hold a BSc
        in Information Technology from JKUAT, where I won multiple hackathons
        and built strong leadership and problem-solving skills. I also completed
        the Moringa School software engineering bootcamp, gaining hands-on
        experience in web development, system design, and project management. At
        Founders Hub Africa, I develop and maintain web applications using
        Django and Next.js. I manage DevOps workflows, handling CI/CD pipelines,
        security, and system reliability. My optimizations have improved system
        performance and reduced downtime. Before this, I helped build Afya On
        The Go, a digital health platform that improved healthcare access. I
        designed scalable APIs and a user-friendly interface, ensuring smooth
        interactions for users. I am detail-oriented, adaptable, and always
        eager to learn. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy
        collaborating on innovative solutions. My focus is on delivering
        impactful technology that solves real-world problems. Beyond work, I
        enjoy bird watching and following geopolitical issues.
